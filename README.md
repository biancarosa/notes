    - Solved the [No Idea](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/no-idea/problem)problem. Tried with sets intersections. Failed. Had to read the problem again. First array could contain duplicates and I turned it into a set. Rewrote it. Time: ~15 min
    - Reviewing the [Big O](./BigO.md) notation.
