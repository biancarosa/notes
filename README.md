    - Solved the [No Idea](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/no-idea/problem) problem. Tried with sets intersections. Failed. Had to read the problem again. First array could contain duplicates and I turned it into a set. Rewrote it. Time: ~15 min
    - Reviewing the [Big O](./BigO.md) notation.
    - Implemented the [all_unique_chars.py](https://github.com/biancarosa/CtCI/blob/master/all_unique_chars.py) to solve problem 1.1 on CtCI (pg 90) that asks for a implementation of finding all unique chars on a string without using further data structures. Used my own poor hash table implementation. Time: ~15min.
